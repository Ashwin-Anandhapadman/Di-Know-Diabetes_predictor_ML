# Welcome to Di-Know: A smart diabetes predictor 

## About the project:
This project is my attempt at developing a machine learning-based web application called Di-Know. It aims to check for the presence of diabetes in patients by taking few key variables as input. The following variables are used as input for he model:
    1. Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
    2. Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
    3. Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
    4. BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
    5. Age: Age (years)
    5. DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function

The following neural network was designed to predict the presence of diabetes. The dataset for training was obtained from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set).

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes.
